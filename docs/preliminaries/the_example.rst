The Example - A Simple Escrow
=============================

The example we present in this tutorial is a well known problem where smart contracts
are a great solution. It's about exchanging tokens between two users.

The Problem
-----------

Alice and Bob want to exchange tokens. Alice will pay ``k1`` amount of ``A``
tokens and receive ``k2`` amount of ``B`` tokens from Bob. If Alice sends
the tokens directly to Bob’s wallet, then there is no certainty that she
will receive the corresponding payment. Alice should trust Bob after sending her
tokens.
A solution that doesn’t depend on trusting the users must be found.

How to solve it
---------------

A third trusted party can be involved. Instead of paying directly to Bob’s wallet,
Alice locks her tokens into a *smart contract* and specifies what tokens and how many
of them she wants to receive.
The smart contract ensures that Bob will receive his tokens only if he pays
the corresponding to Alice.

From now on, we'll call the *sender* to the user that starts an escrow (Alice), and
the other user (Bob), who ends an escrow by receiving the locked tokens and
sending back the corresponding payment, will be called the *receiver*.

We'll consider three operations:

- **Start**: the sender starts the escrow by locking the funds and setting
  the information about the payment to be received.


- **Resolve**: the receiver gets the locked funds and pays the corresponding tokens
  to the sender, finishing the escrow.


- **Cancel**: the sender cancels the escrow getting back the locked tokens.


eUTxO-model-based solution
--------------------------

An easy solution can be implemented with Plutus scripts. The sender
pays the desired value to a script, specifying all the necessary information:

- Receiver's address ``RA``.
- Sender's address ``SA``.
- Asset Class of token to receive ``B``.
- Amount of tokens to receive ``k2``.

Thus, the validator can express that if a receiver wants to spend the script utxo,
the transaction must be signed by a wallet with address ``RA``, and it must include
a payment of ``k2`` tokens ``B`` to the address ``SA``.


There are several design options for storing the information in a script. We choose
to set the receiver's address as a *parameter* of the script, and the rest of the
escrow information in the *datum*.
This is an arbitrary decision given that all
the information could be located in the parameter (none of the operations need
to change it), as well in the datum. We just want to show in the example how to deal
with a parameterized validator and read/write datums. A consequence of this decision is
that escrows with same receiver address will share the same script address.

In addition to the escrow script, we implement a *minting policy* for checking that
all the information stored in the datum is well-formed at the start of a new escrow.
Every "valid" escrow script-utxo must contain in the value the result of this
minting policy, that we call *control token*. It is burned when escrow is resolved or cancelled.


Operations
~~~~~~~~~~

**Start**. Sender submits a transaction paying to the script ``k1`` tokens ``A``,
and specifies in the datum the address where they want to receive the payment, together
with payment information (amount and asset class).
In addition to that, the value includes the min amount of ADA and the control token.
The datum also includes the asset class of the control token.


The Receiver's address is fixed in the script address (given that it's the validator
parameter).

**Resolve**. Receiver submits a transaction spending the script-utxo and paying to
the Sender (whose address is specified in the datum) ``k2`` tokens ``B``.
The control token is burned.

**Cancel**. Sender submits a transaction spending the script-utxo. The control token
